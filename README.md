# Welcome, this is just a fun side project
yes I did push my build files, I'll remove them later.

## Goals

To build a semi competitent Machine Learning Implementation in C, I've done it before in JS(of course even less serious than this). The End Goal will be to implement interesting AutoEncoder Architectures as I find that to be my favorite aspect of the field.
